# GD Arena - API Contract Specification

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Problem Statement**: Problem Statement 2 (GD Arena)  
> **Target Audience**: Frontend & Backend Engineers  
> **Rule**: This document is the source of truth for all API shapes. Field names must never change without updating this contract and mock response files in the same commit.

---

## 1. Overview & Base URL

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (or `http://<LAN_IP>:8000`)
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **CORS**: Configured for `http://localhost:5173` and `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
- **Mock Mode**: When `MOCK_MODE=true` is set on the backend, all endpoints return deterministic canned responses identical to the shapes defined below. Zero API keys or local LLM required for frontend testing.

---

## 2. Standard Error Format

All error responses across all endpoints follow this standard JSON envelope with an appropriate HTTP status code (`400`, `404`, `422`, `500`):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ROOM_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Room 'room_123' does not exist."
  }
}
```

Standard error codes:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid request payload or parameter out of bounds.
- `ROOM_NOT_FOUND`: The requested room ID does not exist.
- `ROOM_ALREADY_ENDED`: Attempted turn in a room that has already concluded.
- `PROVIDER_ERROR`: Downstream AI provider issue (falls back to degraded response when possible).

---

### 3.4.1 `POST /api/rooms/{id}/join`
Enables friends or peers to join the same discussion room. AI participants dynamically fill the remaining empty seats to maintain the target panel size.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "friend_rahul_99",
  "student_name": "Rahul"
}
```
- **Response**: `200 OK`
```json
{
  "room_id": "room_a1b2c3d4",
  "student_id": "friend_rahul_99",
  "student_name": "Rahul",
  "total_human_count": 2,
  "ai_participant_count": 3,
  "message": "Rahul joined room successfully. AI filled the remaining 3 empty seats."
}
```

---

### 3.5 `POST /api/rooms/{id}/next`
Advances the group discussion by one turn.

#### Dialogue Flow Mechanics:
1. **Student Turn Submission**:
   - The user finishes speaking (push-to-talk released or silence detected).
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/rooms/{id}/next` with `{ student_text, student_started_ms, student_ended_ms, interrupted_turn_id? }`.
   - Backend records the student turn in the transcript, decides the next speaker (AI or Moderator), and returns `{ turn: {...}, next_actor: "ai" | "student", ... }`.
2. **AI Speech Playback**:
   - Frontend plays `turn.text` aloud using browser `window.speechSynthesis` using `turn.voice` pitch/rate/gender hints.
3. **AI Follow-up / Floor Handoff**:
   - When the AI finishes speaking, the frontend calls `POST /api/rooms/{id}/next` with `{}` (empty body or no `student_text`).
   - The backend decides whether another AI participant should respond (`next_actor: "ai"`, `turn: {...}`) OR if the discussion should pause for the student (`next_actor: "student"`, `turn: null` or moderator prompt).
4. **Interruptions**:
   - If the user interrupts while an AI is speaking, the frontend cancels TTS immediately and submits `interrupted_turn_id: "turn_x"`.
   - Backend marks `turn_x` as interrupted and prioritizes the student's text.
5. **Silence / Nudge**:
   - If student has not spoken for an extended duration, backend supplies a `nudge` text in the response.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "student_text": "While that's true, modern AI displaces cognitive skills, not just repetitive manual labor.",
  "student_started_ms": 1728374030000,
  "student_ended_ms": 1728374038000,
  "interrupted_turn_id": "turn_3"
}
```
*(All fields are optional when advancing AI-to-AI turns)*

*Input Modalities Supported by `student_text`*:
- **Voice / Speech (Priority)**: Captured via Web Speech Recognition (STT), passing the final transcribed sentence as `student_text`.
- **Direct Text Input**: If the student prefers typing or microphone access is restricted, typed text is submitted identically via `student_text`. The backend processes both without distinction.

- **Response**: `200 OK` (Case A: AI Speaks Next)
```json
{
  "turn": {
    "id": "turn_4",
    "speaker_id": "kabir",
    "speaker_name": "Kabir",
    "role": "participant",
    "text": "Exactly my concern. A software engineer displaced by AI cannot become a data curator overnight without massive frictional unemployment.",

  },
  "next_actor": "ai",
  "phase": "discussion",
  "remaining_sec": 195,
  "nudge": null,
  "degraded": false
}
```

- **Response**: `200 OK` (Case B: Floor Passed to Student)
```json
{
  "turn": null,
  "next_actor": "student",
  "phase": "discussion",
  "remaining_sec": 170,
  "nudge": null,
  "degraded": false

```

- **Response**: `200 OK` (Case C: Inactivity Nudge)
```json
{
  "turn": null,
  "next_actor": "student",
  "phase": "discussion",
  "remaining_sec": 140,
  "nudge": "The panel is quiet. Share your viewpoint on how governments should handle reskilling programs.",
  "degraded": false

```json

    "id": "turn_5",
    "speaker_id": "moderator",
    "speaker_name": "Dr. Verma",
    "role": "moderator",
    "text": "Let us keep our arguments focused on the economic implications. Who wants to build on that?",
    "t_ms": 1728374045000,
    "voice": {
      "gender_hint": "female",
      "pitch": 1.0,

*Crucial Backend Guarantee*:
- Speaking share and word counts are computed **deterministically in code**.
- Every single quote inside `criteria_scores` is **strictly validated** against the transcript. If an LLM hallucinated a quote that is not present in the room transcript, the validation engine drops or replaces it with an authentic utterance from the session.
